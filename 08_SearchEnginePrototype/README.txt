Project: Search Engine Prototype
--------------------------------
-Key Features:

Developed a basic search engine prototype in C++ for document indexing and retrieval.
Implemented tokenization and basic stemming for text processing and indexing.
Utilized std::unordered_map for efficient document indexing and retrieval.
Integrated file handling (ifstream) for reading document content from text files.
Implemented basic search functionality allowing users to query indexed documents.


Technologies and Skills:

-Programming Languages: C++
-Libraries and Tools: Standard Template Library (STL), File I/O (ifstream), Smart Pointers (std::shared_ptr)
-Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures, Algorithms
-Text Processing: Tokenization, Stemming
-Development Practices: Modular Design (Header and Source Files)
-Problem Solving: Implemented error handling for file operations and user interactions.
